## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1.  Fork and clone the repository
2.  Create a development branch: `git checkout -b dev-yourname`
3.  Install development dependencies:
    `devtools::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)`

### Making Changes

1.  Ensure your branch is up to date with main
2.  Make changes and add tests
3.  Run checks locally: `devtools::check()`
4.  Update documentation: `devtools::document()`
5.  Update NEWS.md with user-facing changes

### Submitting Changes

1.  Push to your development branch
2.  Ensure GitHub Actions pass
3.  Merge into main when ready (Please request review from @jamiectam)

### Coding Standards

- Use `snake_case` for functions and variables
- Document all exported functions
- Include examples in documentation
- Add tests for new functionality in testthat structure

### Git Branching Strategy

- Use `main` for stable releases
- Use `dev-*` branches for development
- Use descriptive branch names for features or fixes
- Regularly merge `main` into your development branch to keep it up to
  date
- Use pull requests for code reviews and merging
